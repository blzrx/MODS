Mighty Online Diagnostic Script, a expect based script-tool

This basic script was designed to make a automatization when issuing script to a cisco based device.

It uses the expect tool to send and receive string, then save them to a output file.

It needs the following dependencies:

expect
apache2/httpd
tput
telnet/ssh client
ex
sudo

It was designed to do the following:

Main.sh
  This script invokes the sub-scripts inside a folder, in the same directory (Called fuentes on this case), which has the expect scripts, to connect and retreive information from the devices, you should know how to create a expect script to make this work.
  
  At a early stage of execution, creates (or deletes) a file called last.file, which contains the name of the last file created, this file is used as a kinda file-based-variable-pass.
  
  After finishes the execution, everything is saved on a file, the filename is the content of the last.file
  
cleaner.sh
  This script should be edited in order to remove the trash lines from the output file generated by main.sh, to make it more user-friendly, the purpose is clean it to export to a web-interface based file-browser (in my environment i use a h5ai file-server).
  
updater.sh
  This script copy the file generated by the main.sh script and cleaned by the cleaner.sh script to the web server (By default it could be /var/www/), so, from a web-browser you could see the file in a easier way, it needs sudo permission.
  
Every script contains a example of how-to.
